        <p>My name is Saikiran, and I am a first-year undergraduate student at <br/> Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, studying Computer <br/> Science and Engineering. I have a strong interest in web, app <br/> development and competitive programming.</p>

            <p>In addition to web app development, I am also an active competitive <br/> programmer. I regularly participate in coding contests organized by <br/> platforms like CodeChef and LeetCode. These contests allow me to <br/> sharpen my problem-solving skills and stay updated with the latest <br/> coding trends and techniques.</p>
            
            <p>I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. I enjoy working <br/> with fellow programmers and designers to bring innovative ideas to life. <br/> Through effective communication and a collaborative mindset, I <br/> actively contribute to group projects, creating solutions that make a <br/> positive impact. </p>
            
            <p>As I progress in my educational journey, I am eager to gain practical <br/> experience through internships and real-world projects. My passion for <br/>web app development and competitive programming drives me to <br/> continuously learn and grow, enabling me to contribute effectively to <br/> the dynamic field of technology.</p>
